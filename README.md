This is a static HTML site designed using the Jekyll theme "Minimum Mistakes". The site currently redirects to chrisliow.com. The site is still very basic and has a lot on the 'To-Do' list.
* Add page for tutoring service
* Format main/landing page to change post listing appearance
* Complete script to allow me to add posts/articles remotely
