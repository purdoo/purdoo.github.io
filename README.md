## Getting Started

Minimal Mistakes takes advantage of Sass and data files to make customizing easier. These features require [Jekyll 2.x](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/releases/tag/2.1.3) and will not work with older versions of Jekyll.

To learn how to install and use this theme check out the [Setup Guide](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/theme-setup/) for more information.
